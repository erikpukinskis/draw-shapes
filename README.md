Eventually this should be all waves that create SDFs and are quantized via waveform collapse, but IDK how that will work.

Interesting possible equation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine-Gordon_equation Could that standing wave be something we use to model particle motion? I have been thinking about how, for example, to model a house in a scene... if all of the pieces are waves, how do we show one isolated in space? Those animations show a wave that looks like it's isolated in space (although it rotates?)
